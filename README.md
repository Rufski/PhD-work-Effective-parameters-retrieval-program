# PhD-work-Effective-parameters-retrieval-program
This program is designed to take as an input the S-parameters generated by a simulation through the software CST Microwave, and extract the permittivity, permeability, impedance, refractive index, figure of merit, transmission and reflection parameters of the simulated material, outputting a set of plots of these parameters over a specified range of frequency.

The algorithm is based on the following paper:
Hsieh, Feng-Ju, and Wei-Chih Wang. “Full extraction methods to retrieve effective refractive index and parameters of a bianisotropic metamaterial based on material dispersion models.” Journal of Applied Physics 112.6 (2012): 064907.
At times, the following paper has also been used:
Chen, Xudong, et al. “Robust method to retrieve the constitutive effective parameters of metamaterials.” Physical Review E 70.1 (2004): 016608.

Input files: 4 files names S11a.txt, S11p.txt, S21a.txt, S21p.txt containing the transmission (S21) and reflection (S11) amplitude (subscript a) and phase (subscript p) generated by CST Microwave simulation.

Output files: 9 graphs plotting the effective parameters mentioned in the first paragraph over the range of frequency covered by the S-parameter input files.

Parameters to adjust within the program before running: frequnit, lengthunit, L10, L20, SlabThick, L1a, L2a.
